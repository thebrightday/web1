    Jeju Island introduced the K-mean algorithm to deploy charging stations efficiently. As a solution to the current charging infrastructure problem, we propose a large number of chargers per station. The location of the large charging station was selected based on several factors, such as population density, tourist attractions, and hotels[3]. The another case In Tokyo, they has introduce Boronoi diagram. It is geometric mapping methods to help align the utilization distances of facilities such as posts, libraries, and police stations. These public facilities must be properly arranged to meet the needs of the surrounding residents. It takes into account the number of people in the city, the distance between charging stations, the utilization rate[4]
