    The supply of electric and hydrogn fuel cars is increasing, but charging stations are still scarce. The another problem is that there are no charger can be used even If there is charging station. for this reason, people have to move around another charging station. These problems can become more serious as the use of electric vehicles expands.[1] we can see the same problem about the point of view hydrogen Fuel cell vehicle(HFCV). Hydrogen fuel, as well as electricity, is one of the eco-friendly vehicle fuels. In the case of hydrogen charging stations, the problem is even worse. There are 539 gas stations and 78 LPG charging stations in Seoul, but only four hydrogen charging stations.[2] Though numerical of supplying HFCV in Korea is the highest of the world, the infrastructure of it is too lack. A common feature of them is scarce of charging infrastructure which is primary problem. It is important not only to put the number of chargers but also to put them in proper positions. Thus it is need to know how each nation solve this matter.
